Requirements
================================================================================

* Open the photoAlbum.html file with firefox or explorer

* NB: For some strange reasons that so far i havent cracked, if you open the html file initially the image does not display.
	However, if you click on any button the images are displayed fine.This happens initially when loading the page.
	
* An attempt was made on some server side scripting but was was left incomplete.
